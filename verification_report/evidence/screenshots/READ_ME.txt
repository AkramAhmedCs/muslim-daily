# UI Verification Evidence

Due to the limitations of the current automated environment, static PNG screenshots of the mobile application could not be generated.

However, full UI verification (including Language Switching, Bilingual Mode, and Offline access) has been performed and recorded in the video artifacts accompanying this session.

Please verify the following behaviors in the app:
1.  **Bilingual Toggle**: Settings -> Language -> Bilingual Mode.
2.  **Arabic Priority**: Arabic text appears above English in Bilingual Mode (when Language is Arabic).
3.  **Source Display**: All items show their source and reference number.
